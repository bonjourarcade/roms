Sometimes, the best decision is not to make one. - Consent (\"No one objects.\") - Is not the same as consensus: it means that no one opposes the idea even if they don't agree. - Consultative (\"I will consult before deciding.\") - Requires being clear about why you are asking for input.

They love facts and theories and working with a systematic approach. - Executors can also be thought of as Implementers. They ensure that important activities are carried out and goals accomplished; they are focused on details and the bottom line. - Flexors are a combination of all four types.

Leaving the workplace at 2:00pm is not early. 1. Nobody talks about how many hours they work. 1. :hot_pepper: Every meeting is optional 1. It's ok to grocery shop on a Wednesday morning, catch a movie on a Tuesday afternoon, or take a nap on a Thursday afternoon. 1. There are no work schedules. 1. Nobody feels guilty, overworked, or stressed-out. 1. There aren't any last-minute fire drills. 1. There is no judgement about how you spend your time."
